## Mini Project - Flappy Bird Reflection

Upon receiving the project, I decided to follow the youtube tutorial in the slides: https://youtu.be/cXgA1d_E-jY?si=uA_FMvTNjQxPk8Ca, and managed to get a playable without a collision feature. Though the video only covered the foundation to start the game , I had a better understanding of how everything worked from scratch and a clearer idea of specific places to add certain systems like removing pipes beyond the maximum number specified, add scores etc. I used classes for the bird and pipes and realised how useful having a placeholder is, to pass in whatever values, whenever. Even more so with arrays, to control multiple items simultaneously. 

In the second version, I added the collision detection with a few if conditions to check if the bird’s x and y collided with the pipes’. If true, feedback with a red fill. 

In the third version, near to completion, I added states with switches as it was overwhelming with booleans alone. I replaced the visual placeholders with conceivable pipes and a bird. I realised I forgot to add detection for floor and ceiling as well, and fixed that. Fill and text colors were changed to take from the palette array for easy changes. Regarding the look of the game, I wanted a retro theme, but the bird pixels alone took about 20 lines of rectangle creation, thus, I opted for the traditional shapes.

In the final version, I added one more class to have the bird randomly take a dump, as birds do. I applied what I learnt from the bird and pipe class to set it up. It took longer than anticipated, but after numerous undefined errors, I managed to have an array with  “poo” that will be pushed in one out of three chances every certain amount of frames.

Overall, I enjoyed the project thoroughly and am more confident in my logical skills with a better grasp of the concepts-arrays, classes, booleans, for loops, and conditions.
